# League Akari UI Components

Use this skill for the UI component details listed here.

## Component Family Consistency

Treat consistency across related components as a product requirement, not optional polish.

Before implementing or changing a component, inspect nearby production components and other members of the same UI family. Establish the existing pattern across layout, visual tokens, iconography, interaction states, semantic primitives, and public imports, then apply that pattern consistently throughout the affected family. Do not introduce a one-off convention for a single component.

When existing examples disagree, compare several recently authored or modernized production components and follow the coherent current pattern that satisfies the requirement. Do not use an isolated legacy or Storybook-only example as the standard.

If the established family pattern cannot support the new requirement, refactor all affected siblings to the replacement pattern in the same change. Do not leave a partially migrated component family with old and new conventions mixed together. Review the relevant siblings as part of validating any component change.

## Component Interpolation

Use `TranslationComponent` from `i18next-vue` when a translated sentence needs Vue-rendered fragments inside it, such as highlighted text or other inline component content.

Do not use the global `<i18next>` alias in Vue templates. Use the explicit `TranslationComponent` name so Vue tooling can provide component type hints.

Keep word order and punctuation in the locale file. In YAML, place named component slots with `{slotName}`. In the Vue component, provide matching named slots.

```vue
<TranslationComponent :translation="t('playerTabs.matchHistory.collectMode.collectedPageDescription')">
  <template #scanned>
    <TranslationComponent
      :translation="t('playerTabs.matchHistory.collectMode.scannedMatches', { count: scannedCount })"
    >
      <template #count>
        <span class="count-highlight">{{ scannedCount }}</span>
      </template>
    </TranslationComponent>
  </template>
  <template #collected>
    <TranslationComponent
      :translation="t('playerTabs.matchHistory.collectMode.collectedMatches', { count: collectedCount })"
    >
      <template #count>
        <span class="count-highlight">{{ collectedCount }}</span>
      </template>
    </TranslationComponent>
  </template>
</TranslationComponent>
```

```yaml
collectedPageDescription: This page is a collection-mode result with {collected} from {scanned}.
scannedMatches_one: '{count} scanned match'
scannedMatches_other: '{count} scanned matches'
collectedMatches_one: '{count} collected match'
collectedMatches_other: '{count} collected matches'
```

## Pluralization

Use i18next plural suffixes for count-dependent text:

```yaml
someKey_one: '{{count}} game'
someKey_other: '{{count}} games'
```

Pass the controlling number as `count`.

When one UI sentence contains more than one independent count, do not put all count-dependent nouns in one translation key. Split the sentence into smaller translated phrases so each pluralized key has one `count` controller, then compose those phrases through `TranslationComponent`.

This avoids incorrect English such as treating both counts as plural when one of them is `1`.

- `src/shared/i18n/en/renderer/ongoing-game.yaml` keys under `ongoingGame.junglePathing.campPopover*`

## Tailwind Utilities

Use Tailwind CSS v4 syntax in templates and SFC styles.

When a Vue SFC uses Tailwind utilities inside a `<style>` block, add a Tailwind reference directive before `@apply` or other Tailwind-only CSS usage:

```vue
<style scoped>
@reference '@renderer-shared/assets/css/tailwind.css';

.count-highlight {
  @apply text-akari-700 font-bold;
}
</style>
```

Without this reference, `@tailwindcss/vite` can fail during dev with an error such as `Cannot apply unknown utility class`.

Prefer semantic scale utilities over arbitrary values whenever a matching token exists. Use arbitrary values only when the design truly needs a non-token value, a complex expression, or an authored CSS feature such as `[font-variant-numeric:tabular-nums]`.

Tailwind v4 syntax rules:

| Prefer                                                                        | Avoid                                                                                                   |

| `text-black/82`, `bg-white/10`, `border-black/10`                             | `text-black/[0.82]`, `bg-white/[0.1]`, `border-black/[0.1]`                                             |
| `opacity-75`                                                                  | `opacity-[0.75]`                                                                                        |
| `flex!`, `hover:bg-red-600/50!`                                               | `!flex`, `hover:!bg-red-600/50`                                                                         |
| `text-(--color-akari)`, `fill-(--icon-color)`                                 | `text-[var(--color-akari)]`, `fill-[var(--icon-color)]`                                                 |
| `text-(color:--title-color)`, `text-(length:--title-size)`                    | ambiguous `text-(--title-token)`                                                                        |
| `bg-black/50`, `text-black/50`, `border-black/50`                             | `bg-opacity-50`, `text-opacity-50`, `border-opacity-50`                                                 |
| `shadow-xs`, `shadow-sm`, `blur-xs`, `rounded-xs`, `outline-hidden`, `ring-3` | v3-era assumptions about `shadow-sm`, `shadow`, `blur-sm`, `rounded-sm`, `outline-none`, or bare `ring` |

Also:

- Write arbitrary values with v4 underscore spacing rules, such as `grid-cols-[1fr_500px_2fr]`; escape underscores only when they are literal text.
- Explicitly specify border/divide/ring colors instead of relying on v3 defaults, such as `border border-black/10 dark:border-white/10`.
- Prefer `gap-*` for flex/grid spacing. Use `space-*` only when its selector behavior is intentional.
- Explicitly set cursor utilities on native buttons when needed, such as `cursor-pointer` or `cursor-text`.
- When touching existing Tailwind code, modernize nearby outdated v3 syntax if it is in the edited class list.

## Native Semantic Elements

League Akari uses Naive UI for component primitives and does not include Tailwind's base/preflight layer as the foundation for renderer styling.

When using native semantic elements such as `button`, `input`, `select`, `ul`, `ol`, or heading tags, do not assume browser defaults or Tailwind base normalization will match the surrounding UI. Either:

- Use the matching Naive UI component when it is available.
- Fully specify the native element's spacing, typography, border, background, focus, disabled, and interaction states.
- If the native element is only needed for semantics and its default rendering is undesirable, use a neutral element with the appropriate `role` and accessibility attributes instead.

Use the same semantic primitive for equivalent controls in a component family. Do not mix native elements, role-based neutral elements, and Naive UI controls merely because sibling components were implemented at different times; choose the appropriate convention and align the affected siblings.

The intent is to avoid accidental browser-default controls or text styles appearing inside an otherwise Naive UI-rendered surface.
